# Git Sync Script

This Python script syncs commits between two repositories. It is designed to facilitate synchronization between a private git server and GitHub.

## Features

- Clones the repository from an upstream URL if it does not exist locally.
- Pulls the latest changes from the upstream repository.
- Pushes the latest changes to the downstream repository.

> :warning: any merge conficts will resolve in error and thus will make the project not sync 

## Configuration

The script uses a configuration file named `sync.conf` to read the repository details. The configuration file should be placed in the same directory as the script.

### Configuration File Format

The configuration file should contain the repository name, upstream URL, and downstream URL, separated by spaces. Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and are ignored.

Example `sync.conf`:

```
#name upstream_url downstream_url

example https://github.com/example_user/upstream.git https://github.com/example_user/downstream.git
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the `sync.conf` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python sync.py
```

### Script Logic

- The script reads the configuration file and processes each repository.
- If the repository does not exist locally, it clones the repository from the upstream URL and sets up the downstream URL.
- If the repository exists locally, it pulls the latest changes from the upstream repository and pushes them to the downstream repository.

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and accessible via the command line.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the repositories.
